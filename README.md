May I invite you to learn more about **Angelman syndrome**?
```Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neuro-genetic disorder that occurs in one in 15,000 live births. Angelman syndrome is often misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy or autism due to lack of awareness. Characteristics of the disorder include developmental delay, lack of speech, seizures, and walking and balance disorders. Individuals with Angelman syndrome will require life-long care.```

The Angelman syndrome gene (UBE3A) is located at chromosome 15, band q12, as depicted. In the brain, the Angelman gene is primarily expressed from the maternally inherited chromosome 15. The diagrams below illustrate the four known genetic mechanisms that cause Angelman syndrome
